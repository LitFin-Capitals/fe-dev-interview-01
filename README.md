# LitFin: Front-End Developer Technical Interview

This assessment is intended for the interviewing Front-End Developer Candidate

## Instructions

1. Add a new CSS class called `selected` that applies different styles to the currently selected item. The selected item should have a background color of `#ff0000` and a text color of `#fff`.
2. Modify the JavaScript code to handle the selection of items. When an item is clicked, it should be marked as selected by adding the `selected` class to it. If an item is already selected and clicked again, it should be deselected by removing the `selected` class from it.
3. Write JavaScript code to log the index of the selected item in the console whenever an item is clicked. The index should be zero-based (i.e., the first item has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, and so on).

Once you've completed the tasks, the web page should display a list of items with the ability to add new items. Clicking on an item should select it and apply the selected class, while clicking on a selected item should deselect it. The index of the selected item should be logged in the console when an item is clicked.
